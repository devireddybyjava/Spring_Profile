Profiles:

When we develop an application in real time that application willbe tested in multiple environments before deploying to production.

Production: Live Environment

How application went to the production?

-->we will test our application in several  environments.

   a) DEV
  b) SIT
  c) UAT
  d) PILOT [pre-production]

environment means we are going to give infrastructure for our application.

suppose a, b, c developers working on different modules, they will connect to the git repository.

suppose our company provides above mentioned  environments and Jenkins tools for build and Deployement purpose.

Jenkins is connected with Git Repo and choosen latest code as well.

Developer are reported their codes into the Git repository, then Jenkins tool will choose latest code for testing on several enviroments such as Dev, SIN(QA), UAT(Userc Acceptance Testing), 
Pilot and production.

a,b,c ---> [   ]  => DEV [Application] ---  Dev schema

Above diagram tells us about deployment and testing on DEV Environment

here application deployed under Dev Enviroment , this Dev contains dedicated Data Schema i.e Dev Schema.  after the completion of Dev testing and deployement , 
it deployed under SIT( System Integration Testing) environment.

Sit [QA] --> testing team will test the application , this SIT contains dedicated Data Schema i.e SIT Schema. Credentails are different for all environments.

here application went to the each environement.

UAT----> this testing will cover at client side. this UAT contains dedicated Data Schema i.e UAT Schema.

Pilot ---> it is pre production testing enviroment. this one also contains dedicated Data Schema i.e PILOT Schema.


Finally we will test production env as well. it is live enviroment.



==>  Data base teams will provides data schemas for environmemts such as DEV schema, SIT schema, UAT schema, PILOT schema.



Every time our application deployed  in enviroments then we need to modify the DB properties [ application.properties or application.yml]


For every environement specific enviroment  properties will beavailable:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

i) DB  ii) SMTP  iii) Logging   iv) Radis Server  v) Kafka   vi) web services/RestAPI  end points


all above mentioned properties are writting under application.properties or application.yml

application-dev.yml
application-qa.yml
application-uat.yml
application-pilot.yml
application.yml    :: spring.profile.active:=dev


profiles:  to configure enviroment specifics

without profiles we need to change the env-env propertioes, it is hectics.
